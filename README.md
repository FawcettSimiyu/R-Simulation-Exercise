# R Simulation Exercise

## Part 1: Simulating an Image

### Overview
This exercise involves simulating an aerial photograph using R. The simulation is based on generating a matrix of numbers that represents pixel values in an image, with each number corresponding to a specific color level on an 8-bit scale (0-255).

### Components

- **Simulation Exercise**: Use a UAV (Drone) equipped with a GoPro Hero 3+ to capture aerial images. The images are represented by matrices of pixel values.
  
- **Matrix of Numbers**: The image is simulated by creating a matrix where each element represents a pixel value ranging from 0 to 255, corresponding to different color levels.
  
- **Color by Numbers**: The matrix of numbers is then colored to simulate an actual aerial photograph.

### Classification and Reclassification

- **Classification Scheme**: The pixel values are classified into ranges (e.g., 0-20, 21-40, etc.) to simplify the image data.
  
- **Reclassification**: The classified image is reclassified based on the specified classification scheme to highlight different features in the image.

### Tasks

1. **Generate a Matrix of Numbers**: Write R code to create a matrix of numbers representing pixel values.
2. **Generate a Simulated Image**: Write R code to simulate an image based on the generated matrix.
3. **Classify the Simulated Image**: Write R code to classify the simulated image based on the predefined ranges.
4. **Reclassify the Simulated Image**: Write R code to reclassify the image to emphasize specific features.
5. **Document the Code**: Provide thorough documentation of the code used for the above tasks.
